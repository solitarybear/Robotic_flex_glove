# Robotic_flex_glove
This project demonstrates a wearable glove interface using flex sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller. Each finger movement is captured via flex sensors, and real-time values are printed to the Serial Monitor. This setup can be extended to control robotic hands, create sign language translators, or develop gesture-based automation systems.
